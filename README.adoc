= Microservices Project: Level 4

This project is part of a series for creating microservices. In this repository, we use the following technologies:

* Spring Boot
* Java
* REST services
* Lombok
* MongoDB document database
** running in Docker container
** loaded with Book/Author domain data

For the domain, we loaded a publicly-available https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home?authuser=0[UCSD Book Graph dataset^] that provides books and related information.

== Architecture

We have 3 services in this repository: `service1`, `service2`, and `service3`. Our architecture has changed slightly from the previous https://github.com/JMHReif/microservices-level3[Level3^], as we have added a new service for book authors. Responsibilities of each service are outlined below.

* Service1: backend service for interacting with stored book data and hosting the REST api endpoint (`localhost:8081/db/books`)
* Service2: client REST service for calling the available REST endpoint in service1 and returning any results (books)
* Service3: backend service for interacting with stored author data and hosting the REST api endpoint (`localhost:8082/db/authors`)

With all three services running, we can use service2 to call service1 for the books backend, and separately call service3 from the command line for the authors backend.

== Microservices functions

There are a variety of reasons businesses and users might choose to develop applications in a microservices architecture. Some potential reasons are listed below.

* Scalability
* Functionality independence (separating grouped features, often for reliability)
* Maintenance simplicity (changes only affect pieces, and less likely to impact whole)
* Shift resource load (from large instance running single monolith application, to many smaller instances hosting/coordinating microservices)

== Executing the services

To reproduce this intro example, please follow the steps.

1. Clone this repository
2. Run each service (either from an IDE or command line)
3. Test backing service (books): Open a command line window and execute `curl localhost:8081/db/books`.
4. Test client service: Open a command line window and execute `curl localhost:8080/goodreads/books`.
5. Test backing service (authors): Open a command line window and execute `curl localhost:8082/db/authors`.
6. See the results of books or authors appear :)
